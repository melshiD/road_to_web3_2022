you will have to send it to metamask after buying


Jacob Willemsma 13:19
On testnets though there are faucets and no need to buy. Deploying to mainnet is the final step and not a requirement for the event.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c nice video on zero knowledge proof


Theisha Marie 13:29
In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.


Natoshi Sakamoto 13:29

eth 2.0 will settle on Polygon zK tech. It is a good development for both sides.

@CryptoM0nk3y is better than having zero knowledge to run optimistic ones, lol

Is there a conflict in how Web3 gaming devs can simultaneously create composable building blocks (engines, UI tech, platforms more generally) while also being incentivized to create those composable building blocks?

One question popping up for copyright owners is, how do we protect copyrighted content on Web 3 and inherently decentralized platforms (where there is no central authority)?


Satoshi Nakamoto 14:25
@Diego ..clarification: by infinite games type of thinking u mean open wrld games or something else?


Diego Bonifacino 14:26
@satoshi, what do you mean by world games?


Satoshi Nakamoto 14:26
i mean open world games....like world of warcraft


Stephen McCarthy 14:26
"There are at least two kinds of games. One could be called finite, the other infinite. A finite game is played for the purpose of winning, an infinite game for the purpose of continuing to play."
