you will have to send it to metamask after buying


Jacob Willemsma 13:19
On testnets though there are faucets and no need to buy. Deploying to mainnet is the final step and not a requirement for the event.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c nice video on zero knowledge proof


Theisha Marie 13:29
In cryptography, a zero-knowledge proof or zero-knowledge protocol is a method by which one party (the prover) can prove to another party (the verifier) that a given statement is true while the prover avoids conveying any additional information apart from the fact that the statement is indeed true.


Natoshi Sakamoto 13:29

eth 2.0 will settle on Polygon zK tech. It is a good development for both sides.

@CryptoM0nk3y is better than having zero knowledge to run optimistic ones, lol

Is there a conflict in how Web3 gaming devs can simultaneously create composable building blocks (engines, UI tech, platforms more generally) while also being incentivized to create those composable building blocks?

Interesting article on "Soulbound" NFTs by Vitalik recently: https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html We should start thinking about using NFTs within gaming as signaling shared experiences as well as wealth!

@Stephen Plurality is less nerdy and we can reduce the asymmetries of the information. Information is not equally available to all parties at the same time.

torchhorse üî•üêé 14:12
How do you see gnosis zodiac overlapping in the metaverse of our world IRL vs. 'game' worlds.


Luis Xavier Padilla 14:12
> Justin, what are the main keywords a w2 pro would need to understand to be able to make the jump into web3?


Tim Glover 14:12
@kartik Does Justin see traditional companies jumping into Web3/metaverse/NFTs and will they dominate? Or will new Web3/crypto companies build from the ground up to dominate this space?


Phat Whale 14:13
Interesting question @Tim!


Stephen McCarthy 14:17
Any thoughts on methodologies or crypto primitives that might let us synthesize game economies or game mechanics to create experiences that goes beyond any one game?


Stephen McCarthy 14:18
*experiences that go beyond any one game?

Highly recommend to read: finite and infinite games by James Carse


Diego Bonifacino 14:24
Gaming in crypto should go more towards the infinite games type of thinking...
